<h1>Flight Fare Prediction Project</h1>
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting airline ticket prices based on historical flight data. The model uses various features such as airline, source and destination, flight duration, and number of stops to provide accurate fare predictions.
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to flights, including:

<b>Airline</b>: The name of the airline.<br>
<b>Source City</b>: The city from which the flight originates.<br>
<b>Destination City</b>: The city where the flight lands.<br>
<b>Date of Journey</b>: The date on which the flight is scheduled.<br>
<b>Flight Duration</b>: The total duration of the flight.<br>
<b>Total Stops</b>: The number of stops during the flight.<br>
<b>Price</b>: The target variable representing the ticket price.
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h4>Data Preprocessing<h4>
Managed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized data to prepare it for modeling
<h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4> Conducted data analysis and visualizations to uncover insights and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
<h4>Feature Engineering</h4> Engineered new features like days_until_departure and flight_duration to improve model accuracy.
<h4>Model Development</h4> Implemented and tuned a Random Forest Regressor model, achieving high accuracy in fare predictions.
<h4>Model Evaluation</h4> Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
